# Sorting Algorithms

This project provides C implementations of various sorting algorithms. The implemented algorithms include:

- Bubble Sort
- Heap Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Selection Sort
- Shell Sort

## Getting Started

To compile and run the test file, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/amartinsmg/SortingAlgorithms.git`
2. Change to the project directory: `cd SortingAlgorithms`
3. Build the test executable using the provided Makefile: `make test`
4. Execute the test program: `./build/test`

## Usage

The test program allows you to evaluate the performance and correctness of the implemented sorting algorithms. It utilizes three distinct arrays of doubles, integers, and long longs, and applies each sorting algorithm to these arrays. The program compares the sorted arrays with pre-sorted arrays to validate the correctness of the algorithms.
